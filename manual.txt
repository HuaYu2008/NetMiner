* A guideline for high-confidence gene co-expression network inference based on the large-scale open access RNA-seq dataset

* To run this pipeline, you need the high-performance computing clusters and install Portable Batch System

* This pipeline depend on the following software
1.
2.
3.
4. 

Step 1. Trimming and filtering the downloaded RNA-seq reads

Step 2. Mapping and calculating gene expression abundance 

Step 3. Inferring individual gene co-expression network Using WGCNA,GGM and BC3NET

Step 4. Constructing the high-quality consensus network using ensemble-based system
